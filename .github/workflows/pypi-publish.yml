# PyPI Publish Workflow
# 
# This workflow MUST be local to each repository due to PyPI Trusted Publishers
# security requirements. Reusable workflows from other repositories cannot be 
# used with PyPI Trusted Publishers because PyPI validates the exact workflow
# file that executes the publish action.
#
# See: https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/
